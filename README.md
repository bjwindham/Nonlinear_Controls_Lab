Welcome!

The Quanser Arduino Simulink Setup Instructions.pdf file contains all the information that could possibly need in order to set up the Quanser controller and hardware. It also provides a comprehensive explanation of the example Simulink setup and running it on your hardware setup.
If you find any area of the tutorial lacking, please reach out to me and I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have.
